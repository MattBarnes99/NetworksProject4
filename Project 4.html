    <h1>Project 4: GetMyMusic!</h1>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
    The goal of Project 4 is for students to build <i>GetMyMusic!</i>,
    a file/music synchronization application. Students will build both 
    client and server capable of range of different functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Due:</b> Thursday, December 2, 11:59:59 p.m.
      <b>There will be no extension to this due date or time! 
      Anything submitted after the deadline will not be accepted!</b><br>
    <b>Points:</b> 60<br>
    <b>Teams:</b> Students <i>must</i> work in groups of size 3. Because there are 11 students taking
    this class for a grade, there must also be one group of size 2.  The group of size two will be
    approved by me, so that I know there is only a single group of size two.  Students should note that it
    may be the case that not all members of a team receive the same grade!
    </p>

    <p>
    Like so many other people, Prof S is frustrated with the fact that
    every machine he owns has a different collection of songs in his iTunes
    library. Moreover, Prof S does not want to use iCloud to solve this
    because he wants his music stored on his own devices, not on Apple's servers.
    Students will solve this problem and develop <i>GetMyMusic!</i>, a
    networked application that enables multiple machines to ensure that they
    have the same files in their music directory. 
    </p>

    <p> Clients should be capable of allowing a user to provide login credentials (username and password)
      which are authenticated with the server.  (This need not be via a GUI.  Rather, I recommend doing it
      via the Linux shell prompt).  Note that this means that the server should somehow
      store logon information for valid users, which in turn means that there should be a means of providing
      the server with this valid logon information.  The server should be able to accept this information both
      at startup or while running.  The client should remain logged on for the duration, and NOT
      store authentication information during that time.  
    </p><p> 
      Clients can send one of <b>5</b> messages to the server: 1) Logon
      to the server.  This should happen automatically (rather than via
      a query of a user) whenever a user logs on to the client, and at the start of each client 
      session with the server.  2) List Files (ask
      the server to return a list of files it currently has stored for the specific user associated with
      that client); 3) Diff (based on 2)), the client should show a "diff" of the files it has in comparison to
    the server - both files the server has that the client does not have, and files the client has and
      the server does not have (and again, only for the user currently logged on to the client);
      4) Sync (an operation that (using the information learned in 3))
    pulls to the local device all files for the current user from the server that the local device
    does not have and vice versa); and 4) Leave (the client should end its session
    with the server and take care of any open connections). The server must be
    multithreaded to handle multiple concurrent client requests (reads and
    writes) and store/retrieve historical information about each client in a
    file.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In particular, the following functions will need to be implemented (you may create more
      if you wish -- this is a minimum list)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><tt>LOGON</tt>
	</li><li><tt>LIST</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>DIFF</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>PULL</tt> 
	</li><li><tt>LEAVE</tt> 
    </li></ul>

    <p>
    Unlike your previous projects, no skeleton files will be provided. However,
    I will instead provide design goals which must be met along the
    path towards implementing this project. They are:
    </p>

    <ol>
	<li> Students must develop an overview of the architecture they plan
	to build that will achieve all of the above tasks. This should be
	a written document, saved as a PDF. (3 pts)
	</li><li> Given the above message types, students must define one or more
	structs capable of carrying this information. (6 pts)
	</li><li> Students must develop a centralized server capable of dealing
	  with multiple clients concurrently, some of which may have different
	  current users. You may use either pthreads
	or select(), but you must justify your decision to do so. The 
	server should indicate the current operation it is doing in the
	terminal window. Also, "diff" must actually crawl the directory
	structure and return all files belonging to the current user in the current directory (you do
	not need to open sub-directories). (21 pts)
	</li><li> Students must develop a client implementing a simple 
	interface to allow a user to enter their choices. (21 pts)
	</li><li> Students must develop a means of robustly determining whether
	or not two files, even if named differently, contain the same
	  content (without actually sending the entire file). (9 pts)
	</li><li> Students must develop a means to store the authentication information
	  for each user in such a way that the password is not exposed if the file
	  storing authentication information is revealed.  
    </li></ol>

    <p>
      As usual for this course, your execution environment is the Jepson Linux cluster.
      (E.g., your client and server modules must compile and run on the Linux cluster, which is where
      you will demo them to me.)
    </p>

    <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Each team is to turn in all their files as a single tarfile, submitted, as usual,
      via email to Box (the email address for Project 4 will be sent at a later date.). 
      The tarfile should be named as follows: 
      netid_netid_netid_netid_proj4.tar, where the netids represent, well, your
      netids.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each group <b>must</b> demo their project to me (with all group members present).
      Demos, which should take about 25 minutes per team, will be held on Friday, December 3
      during our lab period.  I expect your entire group to be there.
    </p>
